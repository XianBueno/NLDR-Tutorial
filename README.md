# NLDR-Tutorial

This tutorial is comprised of a somewhat nonlinear presentation of Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction (presented virtually at MIT's Center for Brain, Minds, and Machines in 2020) as well as a supplemental Google Colab notebook with guided examples.

* [Link to Presentation (Video)](https://cbmm.mit.edu/video/nonlinear-dimensionality-reduction)
  - The Classics: Review of PCA (from various angles), Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS), and Kernel PCA. 
  - Shape and Space: Introductory exposition on topology, manifolds, Riemannian geometry and their relationship to NLDR.
  - Manifold Learning: Introduction and discussion of Isomap, Laplacian Eigenmaps, and Diffusion Maps and their properties.
  - Stochastic Dynamics: Some ways NLDR can be used to simplify stochastic dynamical systems. 
* [Link to Tutorial (Google Colab Notebook)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1RJ-3oZjzXYH02ai81QRQinGbr86NQvef?usp=sharing)
  - Discussion and comparision of PCA, MDS, Isomap, t-SNE, Laplacian Eigenmaps, and Diffusion Maps on some toy datasets. 
  
This repository also contains an implementation of Diffusion Maps `diffusionMaps.py` and collection of functions which sample various 
shapes `sample.py`. This repository also has a [pdf version of the slides](https://github.com/XianBueno/NLDR-Tutorial/blob/master/NLDR_Tutorial_slides.pdf).
